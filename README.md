## My process

I wanted to try and make the CSS as 'liquid' as possible without the need to throw a ton of Media Querys around. To achieve that I stuck to mostly using percentages and em's. Also tried to limit using to a ton of flexbox. Wanted to keep the html as clean as possible and really take advantage of the power of CSS alone. Make sure to take advantage of Firefox's great dev tools. Site should work on most devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to appericate and read the CSS documentation, MDN does a great job at making it easy to digest and understand why CSS does the things that it does. The next thing I learned is that flexbox items love to escape their parent element. We need to read more of the documentation to get a frim grasp at working around that. Learned you can stack background images atop of one another to achieve that "tint" effect

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics) - SUPER WELL DONE AND EASY TO FOLLOW. GREAT FOR LEARNING AND UNDERSTANING CSS
